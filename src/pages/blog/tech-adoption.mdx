Helping an organization to adopt new technologies is hard, as I've discovered to my peril on multiple occasions. I've summed up a few obstacles below, along with thoughts on how to navigate.

## 1) Cultural Norms

Culture is the human operating system that runs within organizations. Cultural norms are the rules by how it operates.

Cultural norms help people understand what to expect, providing reassurance against uncertainty and stress. They provide the psychological safety that conversely allows for experimentation and new norms to evolve.

Previously, I hadn't understood that technology choices _are_ cultural norms that cannot be overcome by making straightforward statements on technology X vs technology Y. Cultural norms may sway and bend, but they do not break easily. Sudden and large-scale change will often be met with fierce and entrenched resistance.

To introduce a technical change such as new language or different programming approach, we must win trust over time. We do this by showing that the new tools are complimentary to existing skills and experience, that will enrich rather than change for change's sake.

Technology is just tooling, and should never be imposed top-down, or coerced bottom-up by stealth. No matter how good the tech is, people will fight you all the way.

## 2) The business

I've been there, wanting to introduce a cool new piece of tech, then the CTO suggests that my idea is just a _"technology searching for a problem"_.

We need to always be showing tangible gains for the business, demonstrating that it's possible to [beat the averages](https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html), by doing something different.

I've noticed that when a team is delivering successfully for the business, to the extent of winning industry awards, then questions stop arising of what technologies were used. What gets talked are the broader themes for success such as 'data driven', and how it was built in such a flexible way.

## 3) Orthodoxy

I've been guilty of perpetually ramping things up, pushing through a number of new associated technologies as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've tried to conquer nay-sayers with deus-ex machina, but the response is often: _'what the hell is this now, on top of the other thing!'_, _'no way!'_.

Striving to achieve too much, too soon can risk change fatigue, and has people reaching for the current orthodoxy, which wasn't working so well to begin with.

This can be compounded if the organizaton is then hit by broader challenges, such as economic, or high-level policy changes. When this happens then there is a human drive to circle the wagons.

For change to survive long-term, after the initial period of adoption, then technology needs to remain discrete and low-profile.

You need change agents with new perspectives, but you also need the bridge-builders and long-term system-thinkers, who can evolve standards and existing governance, which give new technologies _roots_.

## 4) Management-Led Engineering

So often in our industry, there exists a culture of process-heavy micro-management by non-technical project managers.

Many companies have recognised the value of having an engineering-led culture, entrusting developers with autonomy that allows creativity to flourish, that will in turn lead to better, more efficient results.

Sometimes a reboot is needed, and this can go hand-in-hand with introducing new technologies.

One such approach is 'Programmer Anarchy', which is ripping off the band-aid and fully entrusting developers to meet the business goals.

This is a high risk/reward revolutionary approach requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to maintain the course. Buy-in is needed across the board, including from new and existing employees, to take more responsibility.

Many initiatives will die out over time, sapping energy and creating rifts in the process. There is also the risk that the technology choices that survive the initial period of anarchy, might not be the ones that fit the organization long-term.

And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then it will be have been worth it.

## 5) The Ivory Tower

When technology choices are made from a distance, disconnected from day-to-day pains and opportunities, it becomes difficult for better approaches to win favour. Making the case for change is hard when the decision-makers aren't close enough to the practical realities of their chosen tech.

The term ['Platform Engineering'](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-platform-engineering) is in vogue and for good reason. I have seen technology change thrive where a team exists that supports other development teams, rather than prescribing mantras for them to obey.

This move away from command and control ivory-tower dictatorship, to offering genuine support and aligning with developers' needs in a bottom-up fashion, is triggering a rapid acceleration of cloud and modern technology adoption by large institutions. Winning hearts and minds with thoughtful tooling, developer experience, attractive documentation, and providing the necessary builtin integrations (such as security and logging), allows for developers to focus on what they need to do, to advance the business forward.

Empowerment rather than control.

## Conclusion

Helping companies to adopt new technologies is not easy. Make sure it's not a hospital pass by ensuring that a) there exists a culture of trying new technologies and continuous improvement, b) you're aligning with the business early, c) play the long game and remain discrete, d) think carefully before triggering a revolution, and e) it's all about support/empowerment.
