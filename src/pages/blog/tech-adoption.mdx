Here are 5 blockers to helping a company adopt new technologies, and some thoughts on how to navigate.

== 1) Cultural Norms

Culture is the human operating system that runs within organizations. Cultural norms are the rules by how it operates.

Cultural norms help people understand what to expect, providing reassurance against uncertainty and stress. They provide the psychological safety that conversely allows for experimentation and new norms to evolve.

Previously, I hadn't understood that technology choices _are_ cultural norms that cannot be overcome by making straightforward statements on technology X vs technology Y. Cultural norms may sway and bend, but they do not break easily. Sudden and large-scale change will often be met with fierce and entrenched resistance.

To introduce a technical change such as new language or different programming approach, we must win trust over time. We do this by showing that the new tools are complimentary to existing skills and experience, that will enrich rather than change for change's sake.

Technology is just tooling, and should never be imposed top-down, or coerced bottom-up by stealth. No matter how good the tech is, people will fight you all the way.

== 2) The business

I've been there, wanting to introduce a cool new piece of tech, then the CTO suggests that my idea is just a _"technology searching for a problem"_.

We need to always be showing tangible gains for the business, demonstrating that it's possible to [http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html](beat the averages), by doing something different.

I've noticed that when a team is delivering successfully for the business, to the extent of winning industry awards, then questions stop arising of what technologies were used. What gets talked are the broader themes for success such as 'data driven', and how it was built in such a flexible way.

== 3) Orthodoxy

When an organizaton is hit by broader challenges, such as economic, or high-level policy changes, then there is a human drive to veer towards orthodoxy.

For change to survive long-term, after the initial period of adoption, then technology needs to remain discrete and low-profile.

I've been guilty of doing the opposite and perpetually ramping things up, pushing through a number of new associated technologies as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've tried to conquer nay-sayers with deus-ex machina, but the response is often: _'what the hell is this now, on top of the other thing!'_, _'no way!'_.

You need change-agents who can inspire and lead a path, but you also need the bridge-builders and long-term system-thinkers, who can effect change in a responsible and measured way, able to operate under the benign influence of existing cultural norms and sound foundational governance.

Work with the Orthodoxy, to prevent becoming a target for it.

== 4) Revolution

What if the technical culture of a company has hit a dead-end, and senior management order a reboot?

I've seen this in action labelled as 'Programmer Anarchy'. Where I saw it, there was buy-in from the existing employees, and the new joiners also. It was a collective adventure.

It can be messy. Many initiatives will die out over differing lengths of time, sapping energy and creating division in the process. The technology choices that survive the initial anarchy, might not be the ones suitable for the long-term.

And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then it will be have been worth it.

The high risk/reward revolutionary approach above all requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to maintain the course, for no doubt it will be a rocky one. Don't attempt it without buy-in at all levels.

== 5) The Ivory Tower

The term ('Platform Engineering')[https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-platform-engineering] is in vogue and for good reason. I have seen technology change thrive where a team exists that see themselves as supporting other development teams, as to prescribing mantras for them to obey.

This move away from command and control ivory-tower dictatorship, to offering genuine support and aligning with developers' needs in a bottom-up fashion, is triggering a rapid acceleration of cloud and modern technology adoption by large institutions. Winning hearts and minds with thoughtful tooling, developer experience, attractive documentation, and providing the necessary builtin integrations (such as security and logging), allows for developers to focus on what they need to do, to advance the business forward.

Empowerment rather than control.

== Conclusion

Helping companies to adopt new technologies is not easy. Make sure it's not a hospital pass by ensuring that a) there exists a culture of trying new technologies and continuous improvement, b) you're aligning with the business early, c) play the long game and remain discrete, 4) think carefully before triggering a revolution, and 5) it's all about support/empowerment.
