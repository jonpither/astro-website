Helping companies with technology adoption is no a picnic. Let's go through some challenges. Hospital pass?

5 blockers to technology adoption

1) conservative
2) the business
3) The orthodoxy
4) viva la revolution?
5) empower not control

== 1) Cultural Norms

Culture is the human operating system that runs within organizations. Cultural norms are the rules by how it operates.

Cultural norms help people understand what to expect, providing reassurance against uncertainty and stress. They provide psychological safe that conversely allows for experimentation and new norms to evolve over time.

Cultural norms may evolve and sway, but resistance to large-scale change will be fierce and entrenched. Previously, I hadn't understood that technology choices _are_ cultural norms, and aren't overcome by making straightforward comparisons of technology X and technology Y.

To introduce technology change, such as introducing a new language or different programming approach, we must win trust. We do this by showing that the new tools are complimentary to existing skills and experience, that will further help them beat the averages.

Technology is just a tool that should never be imposed top-down, or coerced bottom-up by stealth. No matter how good the tech is, people will fight you all the way out the building.

== 2) The business

I've been there, wanting to introduce a cool new piece of tech, and then the CTO or a more senior stakeholder figure, suggests that my idea is just a _"technology searching for a problem"_.

Always be making clear and tangible gains for the business. We need to show others that the technology we're suggesting is a good bet and isn't just a technology searching for a problem. Demonstrate it's possible to beat the averages.

When a team is delivering successfully for the business, bringing in awards and kudos, then questions very rarely arise of what technologies were used. What gets talked about are the broader themes such as 'data driven', and that it was built in a flexible way.

Keeping technology low-profile, is essential if the hosting organizaton is hit by broader challenges, such as economic, or high-level policy changes. When this happens there is a human drive to veer towards orthodoxy.

The tallest blade of grass is cut down first. Align with the business and remain discrete and low-profile, to protect fragile initiatives.

== Bigger picture

I'm a believer that the choice of programming language offers huge productivity gains and is a critical thing to get right. But I realise that the programming language is just the tip of the iceberg. A technology organization will or die on whether or not it meets the basic hierarchy of needs including good pay, recognition, trust and safety.

Where a culture is built on a foundation of mutual trust, responsibility and accountability, with an embrace of innovation for continuous improvement, then technology change and adoption is not anything new. An outside agency, like a software consultancy, is simply an agreeable resource of new ideas and perspectives.


The choice of technology is simultaneously a critical thing to get right, but also not the most critical. Pick your battlefield.

Orthodoxy:
I've been guilty of rushing through a number of new associated technologies as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've tried to win with deus-ex machina, but the response is often: 'what the hell is this now?', 'no way!'.


== What of revolution?

What if the culture of a company has hit a dead-end, is in acceptance of this, and wants an exciting reboot?

I've seen this in action, having engaged in 'Programmer Anarchy', pioneered by Fred George, who I once worked for. Where I saw it, there was buy-in from the existing employees, and the new joiners also. It was a collective adventure.

The risk is that revolutions are messy. Many initiatives will die out over differing lengths of time, sapping energy and creating rancor. And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then it will be have been worth it.

Programmer Anarchy above all requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to maintain the course. It's a high risk/reward strategy, and you may never be able to know for sure, if it was the correct solution.

== The responsible approach

My errors make me lean towards the a conservative approach. I aspire to be one of the bridge-builders, long term and system thinkers, who effect change in a responsible and measured way, in the midst of my fellow engineers, under the benign influence of good cultural norms and foundational governance.

What are the ramifications for when the people introducing new technologies have moved on? What will it look like for hiring? Will developers from across the company be able to transition across teams? Do new technologies comply with existing and emerging standards? Are they secure? Can your new technologies easily be _replaced_?

It's no surprise to anyone, that technology adoption is hard. When it works, it can change the game for a company.

Yadda - empowerment not contro.

Platforming engineering - supporting. Change in itself is violent and suggests shame, weakness in the status quo.



Early on in my career, in a consulting project that was dubbed 'organizational transformation', I was dispirited by our lack of success in driving through a _revolution_. During a conversation with a colleague, I had a _'what are we really doing?'_ moment. What he responded with stuck with me, that the people I'd been pairing with, teaching TDD or whatever it was back then, that we had enriched their lives and given them new skills, and wasn't that a thing to be proud of?

Organizations may not really change, but people do.


changes to make
- Uplifting
- empowerment not control
