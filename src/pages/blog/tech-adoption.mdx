Here I list 5 blockers to helping a company adopt new technologies, and some thoughts on how to navigate.

== 1) Culture

Culture is the human operating system that runs within organizations. Cultural norms are the rules by how it operates.

Cultural norms help people understand what to expect, providing reassurance against uncertainty and stress. They provide psychological safe that conversely allows for experimentation and new norms to evolve over time.

Previously, I hadn't understood that technology choices _are_ cultural norms that aren't overcome by making straightforward arguments of technology X vs technology Y. Cultural norms may sway and sway, but sudden and large-scale change will often be met with fierce and entrenched resistance.

To introduce technology change, such as a new language or different programming approach, we must win trust over time. We do this by showing that the new tools are complimentary to existing skills and experience, that will enrich rather than simply shake everything up.

Technology is just tooling that should never be imposed top-down, or coerced bottom-up by stealth. No matter how good the tech is, people will fight you all the way out of the building.

== 2) The business

I've been there, wanting to introduce a cool new piece of tech, and then the CTO or a more senior stakeholder figure, suggests that my idea is just a _"technology searching for a problem"_.

Always be making clear and tangible gains for the business. We need to show others that the technology we're putting in can beat the averages.

I've noticed that when a team is delivering successfully for the business, to the extent of winning awards in the industry, then questions stop arising of what technologies were used. What gets talked are the broader themes for success such as 'data driven', and how it was built in such a flexible way.

== 3) Orthodoxy

When an organizaton is hit by broader challenges, such as economic, or high-level policy changes, then there is a human drive to veer towards orthodoxy.

For change to survive long-term, after the initial period of invasive change, then the technology needs to remain discrete and low-profile.

I've been guilty of perpetually ramping things up, rushing through a number of new associated technologies as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've tried to conquer with deus-ex machina, but the response is often: 'what the hell is this now, on top of the other things!', 'no way!'.

You need change-agents who can inspire and lead a path, but you also need the bridge-builders and long-term system-thinkers, who effect change in a responsible and measured way, able to operate under the benign influence of existing cultural norms and sound foundational governance.

== 4) Revolution

What if the culture of a company has hit a dead-end, is in acceptance of this, and wants an exciting reboot?

I've seen this in action, having engaged in 'Programmer Anarchy', pioneered by Fred George, who I once worked for. Where I saw it, there was buy-in from the existing employees, and the new joiners also. It was a collective adventure.

The risk is that revolutions are messy. Many initiatives will die out over differing lengths of time, sapping energy and creating rancor. And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then it will be have been worth it.

Programmer Anarchy above all requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to maintain the course. It's a high risk/reward strategy, and you may never be able to know for sure, if it was the correct solution.

== 5) The Ivory Tower

The term 'Platform Engineering' is fashion,

Yadda - empowerment not contro.

Platforming engineering - supporting. Change in itself is violent and suggests shame, weakness in the status quo.



Early on in my career, in a consulting project that was dubbed 'organizational transformation', I was dispirited by our lack of success in driving through a _revolution_. During a conversation with a colleague, I had a _'what are we really doing?'_ moment. What he responded with stuck with me, that the people I'd been pairing with, teaching TDD or whatever it was back then, that we had enriched their lives and given them new skills, and wasn't that a thing to be proud of?

Organizations may not really change, but people do.


changes to make
- Uplifting
- empowerment not control
